# ReactClient_Blog

A versatile React blog client template built with Vite, Redux Toolkit, and Bootstrap. This project provides a robust frontend application for various types of blogs, featuring global state management with Redux Toolkit, API integration with Axios, and form handling via Formik and Yup. It is designed to work seamlessly with a Django backend (see [DjangoServer_Blog](https://github.com/GuyHasan/DjangoServer_Blog) for the backend implementation).

## Overview

**ReactClient_Blog** is a modern, highly configurable React frontend template for blog applications. It is built with Vite for a fast development experience, Redux Toolkit for state management, and Bootstrap for responsive UI design. This client template is designed to be versatile so that it can be adapted for various blog types. It integrates seamlessly with a Django backend (see our [DjangoServer_Blog](https://github.com/GuyHasan/DjangoServer_Blog) repository for details) and offers features like persistent authentication, dynamic article caching, and more.

---

## Features

- **Versatile Blog Client:**  
  A template that can be adapted for different blog types.
  
- **Global State Management:**  
  Uses Redux Toolkit to manage global state for articles and user authentication, reducing unnecessary API re-fetches.
  
- **User Authentication:**  
  Integrates with JWT-based authentication. The refresh token is stored in session storage to persist the login state, and user roles (e.g., admin, editor) are extracted from the JWT payload.
  
- **API Integration:**  
  Uses Axios for API calls, with separate service modules for articles and authentication.
  
- **Form Handling & Validation:**  
  Uses Formik and Yup for building and validating forms.
  
- **Responsive UI:**  
  Built with React and Bootstrap, ensuring a modern and responsive interface.
  
- **Routing:**  
  Uses React Router DOM for client-side routing between pages.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React** – For building the user interface.
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server.
- **Redux Toolkit** – Simplifies Redux state management and reduces boilerplate.
- **React Redux** – Connects React with Redux.
- **Axios** – For making API requests.
- **Bootstrap** – For responsive UI components.
- **Formik** – For form state management.
- **Yup** – For form validation.
- **React Router DOM** – For client-side routing.
- **ESLint** – For code quality and linting.

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuyHasan/ReactClient_Blog.git
cd ReactClient_Blog
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js (v14 or later) installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

This variable will be used to configure API requests in the frontend. Access it in your code via:

```javascript
const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

---

## Usage

### Versatile Blog Template

- **Article Listing:**  
  The home page displays a list of articles. The articles are cached in Redux, so they won't be re-fetched on every render.

- **User Authentication:**  
  Users can log in to receive JWT tokens. The refresh token is stored in session storage, and the authentication state is managed by Redux. User roles (extracted from the JWT payload) are used to control frontend permissions.

- **Dynamic Routing:**  
  The client uses React Router DOM to handle navigation between pages (e.g., home, login, article details).

---

## Backend Integration

This React client is designed to work with the DjangoServer_Blog backend. Configure the API URL in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

For backend setup details, see the [DjangoServer_Blog README](https://github.com/GuyHasan/DjangoServer_Blog).

## State Management & Redux

### Redux Store

- **Configuration:**  
  The Redux store is set up in `src/redux/store.js`, combining multiple slices (e.g., articles and auth).

### Slices

- **Articles Slice:**  
  Defined in `src/redux/features/articles/articlesSlice.js`. It manages article data, including fetching, pagination, and adding new articles.
  
- **Auth Slice:**  
  Defined in `src/redux/features/auth/authSlice.js`. It handles user authentication, storing tokens, and user roles. The auth state checks session storage for the refresh token to persist login across refreshes.

### Dispatch & Selectors

- **useDispatch:**  
  Used in components to dispatch actions (e.g., fetchArticles, loginUser).

- **useSelector:**  
  Used in components to access the Redux state (e.g., articles, user authentication state).

---

## API Integration

### API Services

- **Article Service:**  
  Located in `src/services/articleService.js`. This module handles API calls for articles (GET, POST, etc.).

- **Auth Service:**  
  Located in `src/services/authService.js`. This module handles authentication-related API calls (login, token refresh).

### Async Thunks

Async actions are created with Redux Toolkit's `createAsyncThunk` to handle API calls. They dispatch pending, fulfilled, and rejected actions that are processed in `extraReducers` to update state accordingly.

---

## Library Roles & Dependencies

### Key Dependencies

- **@reduxjs/toolkit:**  
  Provides simplified Redux setup with slices, async thunks, and immutable state handling.
  
- **axios:**  
  Handles API requests, making it easy to integrate with your backend.
  
- **bootstrap:**  
  Provides a responsive UI with pre-built components.
  
- **formik & yup:**  
  Simplify form management and validation in React.
  
- **react & react-dom:**  
  Core libraries for building and rendering React applications.
  
- **react-icons:**  
  Provides a collection of popular icons to enhance your UI.
  
- **react-redux:**  
  Connects React components to the Redux store.
  
- **react-router-dom:**  
  Manages client-side routing, enabling multiple pages in the SPA.
